# Fashion MNIST Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Objective

"The objective of this project was to develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, and to explore the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance."

## Process
#Description of the dataset : "The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images."

Outline your model architecture. Include a code snippet of your model definition.
Explain your experiment setup: "We experimented with different numbers of convolutional filters (8, 16, 32) and batch sizes (32, 64), training each configuration for 5 epochs."
